Apply for a Job 
Complete the application for a job on the GovernmentJobs.com website. Pay close attention to the requirements when you do. 

Take Any Relevant Exams
Check your email regularly for updates on the status of your application. If your application is accepted, you’ll be invited via email for the exam process. 

Exams vary depending on the position. The exams are job-specific, so they will test skill and knowledge that you may need to perform the job. They may include multiple choice tests, essays, practical tests, and in-person interviews. Timing is different for each exam, so pay close attention to emails you receive. 

Receive Your Score
After your exam, you’ll receive a score. This score indicates how high you rank on the civil service list for your job. 

Receive Job Notifications
After you receive your score, you’ll begin receiving job notifications. (The higher your score, the sooner you’ll start receiving them.) Call the number on the notifications to tell them that you’re interested in interviewing. (The Department will interview the candidates with the top scores who call in, so if you don’t get scheduled for an interview, don’t worry, and just call in for the next one.)

Interview for the Job
Interviews for civil service jobs are generally panel interviews involving two or three panelists. The interview questions are determined in advance, and all candidates are asked the same list of questions. As such, you will not get asked a question like, “Tell us more about your experience at Smith & Co.” Instead, you will more likely get generic questions like, “Tell us how your background and experience prepares you for this position.” The Department will call references for the top-scoring candidates, and the candidate with the strongest qualifications will be offered the position.
